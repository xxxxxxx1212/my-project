This HTML code appears to be a form for updating payment methods, with three tabs representing different payment options: credit card, debit card, and Banco Sicoob. Users can switch between these tabs to select the payment method they want to update.

Here's a breakdown of the structure and functionality of the code:

The HTML structure includes a DOCTYPE declaration, <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.
In the <head> section, there are meta tags for character set and viewport settings, and a title for the webpage.
Inside the <body> tag, there is a container <div> with a heading (<h1>), followed by tabs (<div class="tab">) for different payment options.
Each tab contains a button to switch between payment methods, and clicking on each button triggers the openTab() JavaScript function to display the corresponding tab content and mark the active button.
Within each tab, there is a form (<form>) with input fields specific to the selected payment method.
Input fields include text inputs (<input type="text">) and a dropdown (<select>) for selecting options.
Each form has a submit button (<button type="submit">) to submit the form data.
The <style> section includes CSS styles for the overall layout, tabs, form elements, and background image.
The JavaScript function openTab() handles the tab switching functionality by hiding/displaying tab contents and updating the active tab button's style.

Overall, this code provides a user interface for updating payment information, allowing users to select between credit card, debit card, or Banco Sicoob as their preferred payment method and enter relevant details for each option.
